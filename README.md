I'm excited to share my recent data analysis project, where I explored the vast world of Prime Video. Using DAX, Power BI, and Excel, I designed an insightful dashboard to analyze content trends and reveal actionable insights. Here's how I tackled this project:
The Process: 
1. Data Preparation: I cleaned and structured the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency. 
2. Data Modeling: Leveraged DAX to create measures and KPIs for robust analysis.
3. Visualization: Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI for intuitive storytelling and ease of interpretation.

Core KPIs:
1. Total Titles Analyzed: 9668
2. Average Watch Time : 83.39 Min
3. Unique Genres Covered: 518
4. Content Ratings Represented: 24

Objectives with Solutions:
Objective 1: Which genres dominate Prime Video's content library? 
 Solution: By analyzing genre distribution, I found "Drama, Suspense" and "Comedy, Drama" to be the most prevalent genres, each with over 300 titles.

Objective 2: How is content rated across Prime Video? 
Solution: A closer look revealed that "R" and "PG-13" ratings dominate, highlighting a focus on diverse audiences.

Objective 3: What trends can we observe in content release years? 
Solution: By evaluating release years, I noticed a significant increase in content production post-2000, marking an era of rapid growth and innovation.

Insights Uncovered: 
1. TV shows make up 80.82% of the library, while movies account for 19.18%. 
2. The United States and India emerge as leaders in content creation for Prime Video with an average watch time of 83.39 minute per title, viewer engagement is strong and consistent.

This project showcases the power of data analytics to drive storytelling and decision-making. I'm proud of how I combined advanced DAX, interactive visualizations in Power BI to produce meaningful results.
I'd love to hear your feedback or suggestions on how I could take this further
